	dtkfindcp wf?name [option [value(s)]] ... [option [value(s)]]

Where wf?name is the input wfx(wfn) name, and options can be:
Where wf?name is the input wfx(wfn) name, and options can be:

  -a        	Draw transparent spheres around each nuclei in the wf? file.
  -o outname	Set the output file name (*.log).
            	  (If not given the program will create one out of
            	  the input name; if given, the pov file will
            	  use this name as well --but different extension--).
  -m        	Save the coordinates of atoms, critical points and gradient
            	  paths (if calculated, see option -G) into *dat files.
  -p     	Create a pov file. No image will be generated.
  -P     	Create a png image using povray (calls povray),
         	  deletes pov file.
  -c p   	Set the camera vector direction for the povray scene.
         	  p is an integer which can take the values
         	  001,010,100,101,110,111; the camera will be located
         	  somewhere in the direction (x,y,z), where xyz is one of 
         	  the above values.
  -g     	Draw the gradient paths in the POV file.
  -T     	Set the style for the gradient paths to be tubes.
  -G     	Skip the calculation of the bond gradient paths.
  -r     	Perform the search of ring and cage gradient paths.
  -k     	Keeps the pov file if option -P is used.
  -t cpt 	Set the type of critical point to be searched. cpt can be 
         	  one of the following fields (Density is the default):
         		d (Density)
         		L (Localized Orbital Locator -LOL-)
  -e     	Perform an extended search of critical points. This
         	  will take some more time, but it could find more CPs
         	  than the simple search.
  -v     	Verbose mode (displays additional information (for example the 
         	  output of povray, etc.
  -V        	Display the version of this program.
  -h		Display the help menu.

  --force-bcp-connectivity bcp acp1 acp2 	Try to force the connectivity
            		  of the bcp to be acp1 and acp2. Needed to correct some
            		  cases wherein bond paths are not properly drawn.
            		  The option will try to force the bond path to be
            		  connected between acp1-bcp-acp2.
  --help    		Same as -h
  --version 		Same as -V
