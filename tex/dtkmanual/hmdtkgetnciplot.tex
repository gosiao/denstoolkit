This script computes the NCI field and makes two cubes, and one plot
(s vs rho), which can be used to refine the cubes (by selecting
appropriate cutoffs for rho and s). The script also generates
VMD scripts that automatically loads and visualizes the 
NCI index.

  -h           Display the help menu.
  -w wf?name   Wavefunction name
  -l        	Write cpu time, input/output information etc. on a log file
  -n  dim   	Set the number of points per direction for the cube
            	  to be dim x dim x dim.
  -s        	Use a smart cuboid for the grid. The number of points for the
            	  largest direction will be 80.
  -S ln     	Use a smart cuboid for the grid. ln is the number of points
            	  the largest axis will have. The remaining axes will have
            	  a number of points proportional to its length.
  -r rmin      Set the lower rho cutoff to be rmin
  -R rmax      Set the upper rho cutoff to be rmax
  -G smax      Set the upper reduced density gradient (s) cutoff to be smax
