This script computes the NCI field and makes two cubes, and one plot
(s vs rho), which can be used to refine the cubes (by selecting
appropriate cutoffs for rho and s). The script also generates
VMD scripts that automatically loads and visualizes the 
NCI index.

Options 
  -h           Displays the help menu.
  -w wf?name   Sets the wavefunction name to be 'wf?name' (wfxname/wfnname)
  -c "a1 a2"     Centres the cube to be at the midpoint between atoms a1 and
                 a2. Please mind the quotes to set a1 and a2.
  -f           Forces to re-compute the cubes without asking. This option
                 rewrites previously present cubes.
  -l        	Writes cpu time, input/output information etc. on a log file
  -n  dim   	Sets the number of points per direction for the cube
            	  to be dim x dim x dim.
  -s        	Uses a smart cuboid for the grid. The number of points for the
            	  largest direction will be 80.
  -S ln     	Uses a smart cuboid for the grid. ln is the number of points
            	  the largest axis will have. The remaining axes will have
            	  a number of points proportional to its length.
  -r rmin      Sets the lower rho cutoff to be rmin
  -R rmax      Sets the upper rho cutoff to be rmax
  -G smax      Sets the upper reduced density gradient (s) cutoff to be smax
  -q           Adds 'quiet' to the vmd script (closes vmd after rendering)
