Bugfix: Bond paths are not drawn when only bond paths are computed
i.e., if ring paths are not requested to dtkfindcp, the bond paths
are not displayed in DensToolKitViewer.

Correct the names of QGLWidget/QOpenGLWidget:
When compiling in mac, you may obtain the following message:
To correct this, vim moc_dtkglwidget.cpp and use:
%s/QGL/QOpenGL
Recompile
