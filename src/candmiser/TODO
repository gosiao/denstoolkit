(*) Setup Function3D so that it can choose GaussWaveFunction scalar functions
using pointers to class functions.

(**) After (*) is done, refactor IntegratorVegas so as to make it a derived class of
Integrator3D. IntegratorVegas::Integrand should be replaced by 
a derived class of Function3D. This should be compatible with the
design implemented in (*).
